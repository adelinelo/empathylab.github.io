<p class="p1">&lt;blockquote&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Claire Adida is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego. She uses quantitative methods to study how countries manage new and existing forms of diversity. She has applied this question to the study of immigrant exclusion and ethnic politics in urban West Africa, France, and the United States. Her current research investigates the conditions that reduce out-group discrimination, and the strategies vulnerable minorities employ to navigate discriminatory environments. Her work is funded by the National Science Foundation, the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Hellman Foundation, and the Evidence in Governance and Politics Group.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

The regional focus of her research is sub-Saharan Africa, where she has worked and conducted fieldwork in eight countries since 2005. She received a PhD in political science from Stanford University in 2016, and a BA in Human Biology from Stanford University in 2007 (go Card!).&lt;/p&gt;</p>
